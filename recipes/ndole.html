    <p>Dish: Ndole</p>
    <p>Country: Cameroon</p>    
    <p>Geographic Location: Littoral Region</p>
    <p>Ethnic Group: Douala </p>
    <p> When talking about Cameroonian celebratory dishes,
        Ndole is at the top of the list even in the minds of our friends from other parts of the world. 
        Ndole is the traditional dish of the people from the Littoral Region of Cameroon. It is made using a green leafy vegetable (Bitter leaf) 
        cooked in a creamy peanut sauce and garnished with shrimp and onion then served with a variety of sides. </p>
    <p> Though this dish came specifically from one tribe, 
        it somehow made its way to become Cameroon’s national dish. 
        Many tribes have accepted this dish and have adapted many new ways. 
        Ndole has made its way passed the national boundaries of Cameroon and has gotten 
        into the international space as one of Cameroon’s culinary delicacies</p>

    <li>Drain the hot water and allow cold tap water to run on the bitter to bring it to a room temperature. </li>
    <li>Pour the bitter leaves into a bowl and use both hands to wash the bitter 
        leaves by rubbing them between your palms in an upward and downward motion for five minutes. </li>
    <li>Rainse-off the bittergreen extract with clean water, then strain and squeeze out excess water.</li>
    <li>Repeat step 3 and 4 then set the bitter leaves aside for a later use.</li>
    <li>Boil the groundnuts, allow it to cool and blend into a puree then set aside. </li>
    <li>Wash the meat thoroughly with hot water. Pour it into a pot,
        add 4 cups of water, a salt, and maggi and allow to cook on medium heat until it's ready.  </li>
